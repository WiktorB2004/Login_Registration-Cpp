# Login Registration System - C++ Explore/Practice Project

## Overview
Currently under development - many changes are about to be done.
User login and register application which stores data in txt database file.

## Purpose
This project is created to review newly acquired knowledge, practice usage of C++ and try to use "Pragmatic Programmer" tips on software development.
The code may and most probably will not be perfect, because of my lack of experience with C++ language.
Through making and correcting mistakes + writing the code I can easily gain missing experience alongside with dos and don'ts
of C++ language.
