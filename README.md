# Login Registration System - C++ Explore/Practice Project

## Overview
- Start date: 19.09.2023
- Currently under development - many changes are about to be done.
- This is user login and register application which stores data in txt database file.

## Objective
This project is created to review newly acquired C++ language knowledge, practice usage of Visual Studio and to use "Pragmatic Programmer" tips on making good software.
The code may and most probably will not be perfect, because of my lack of experience with C++ language.
Through making and correcting mistakes + writing the code I can easily gain missing experience alongside with learning dos and don'ts
of C++ language.

## Project Phases (Currently in 1st)
1. Write basic code:
	- Basic logic and functionality
	- Function documentation and comments
	- Basic error handling

2. Analysis of the code, initial refactoring
	- Check the code for bad practices
	- Find better ways to solve problems
	- Add custom and comprehensive error handling

3. Implement more features + Optimize
	- Database file loading
	- Optimize time and memory needed
	- Admin user who can order users to change passwords, remove users etc.
	- Write tests

4. Final changes
	- Make the code as good as possible
	- Create full documentation on project (Readme.md)
	- Redesign project folder structure
