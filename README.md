## Overview
- Start date: 19.09.2023
- Currently under development - many changes are about to be done.
- This is user login and register application which stores data in txt database file.

## Purpose
This project is created to review newly acquired knowledge, practice usage of C++ and try to use "Pragmatic Programmer" tips on software development.
The code may and most probably will not be perfect, because of my lack of experience with C++ language.
Through making and correcting mistakes + writing the code I can easily gain missing experience alongside with dos and don'ts
of C++ language.

## Project Phases (Currently in 1st)
1. Write basic code:
	- Basic logic and functionality
	- Function documentation and comments
	- Basic error handling

2. Analysis of the code, initial refactoring
	- Check the code for bad practices
	- Find better ways to solve problems
	- Add custom and comprehensive error handling

3. Implement more features + Optimize
	- Database file loading
	- Optimize time and memory needed
	- Admin user who can order users to change passwords, remove users etc.
	- Write tests

4. Final changes
	- Make the code as good as possible
	- Create full documentation on project (Readme.md)
	- Redesign project folder structure
