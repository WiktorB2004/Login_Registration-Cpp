# Login Registration System - C++ Practice Project

## Overview
- Start date: 19.09.2023
- Currently under development - many changes are about to be done.
- This is user login and register application which stores data in txt database file.

## Objective
This project is created to review newly acquired C++ language knowledge, practice usage of Visual Studio and to use "Pragmatic Programmer" tips on making good software.
The code may and most probably will not be perfect, because of my lack of experience with C++ language.
Through making and correcting mistakes + writing the code I can easily gain missing experience alongside with learning dos and don'ts
of C++ language.

## Project Phases (Currently in 2nd)
1. Write basic code: (Completed 22.09.2023)
	- ~~Basic logic and functionality~~
	- ~~Function documentation and comments~~
	- ~~Basic error handling~~

2. Analysis of the code and initial refactoring
	- Check the code for bad practices and note in /repair them
	- Find better ways to solve problems

3. Implement more features + Optimize
	- ~~Possibility of erasing current file data if name is taken~~
	- Optimize time and memory needed
	- ~~Manually test the program~~

4. Final changes
	- Redesign project folder structure
